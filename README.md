# Random Password Generator

Welcome to the PyPassword Generator! This Python script allows you to generate a secure password based on your preferences for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.I created this mini-project after completing the topic of lists in Dr. Angela Yu's Python course. By utilizing the random module, I made it easy to generate random passwords.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/saif-islam123/random_passwoed_generator
   cd random_password_generator


2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python pypassword_generator.py

2. Follow the prompts to enter your desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers:


Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
10
How many symbols would you like?
5
How many numbers would you like?
5

3. The script will then generate and display your password:

a8B!c#1D$e2F*G3h&I4
